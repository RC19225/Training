# Training Repository

This repository documents the training I underwent, organized into different branches for each topic. Each branch contains materials, examples, and resources specific to that area of training.

## Branches

- **llm**: Contains materials and examples related to training with Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **git**: (Planned) Will include training materials for Git version control.
- **other-topics**: (Planned) Will cover additional training topics as needed.

## Current Status

Currently, only the `llm` branch is available. This branch includes:
- Example scripts and configurations for working with LLMs.
- Supporting files such as YAML configurations and audio/image assets.

Stay tuned for updates as more branches and topics are added to this repository.
